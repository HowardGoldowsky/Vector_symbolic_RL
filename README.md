# Vector_symbolic_RL
Q-learning-like RL algorithm that utilizes vector-symbolic architecture and hypervectors.
Solves the cart-pole environment. Now includes Double-Q learning and a targt model to 
improve the stability of the reward convergence. This code routinely converges to > 200
iterations upright well within 100 about episodes. Max performance goes into the tens of thousands
of iterations upright.
